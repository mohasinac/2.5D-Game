## What the Engine Can Do Right Now

### Physics

The server runs a synchronous 60Hz Matter.js loop. Beyblades are circles (`radius × 24 px`). Forces are applied from player/AI input via `computeForceMagnitude()` → `Matter.Body.applyForce()`. Collisions fire `Matter.Events 'collisionStart'` → `handleCollision()`, which applies a 5-material damage table, direction-dependent spin steal (same-dir ×0.5, counter ×1.5), and element-type multipliers from `ElementTypeLoader`.

The spin system is complete: `spin`, `spinDecayRate`, `maxSpin`, `spinDirection`, `spinStealFactor`. At < 40% stability, seeded PRNG wobble forces kick in. Counter-rotation sequencing (Dranzer GT) is implemented via `counterRotActive / counterRotStep / counterRotStepTick`.

> **PRNG consistency fix (session 25)**: `BattleRoom.ts` spawn pool selection was using `Math.random()` — an unseeded call that breaks deterministic replay. Fixed to `this.rand()` so all random choices go through the matchId-seeded `createPRNG` instance.

The 2.5D physics layer (`PartPhysics.ts`) extends the core with tip stats (`spinBias`, `bearingFriction`), material stats, and CP radial gating (±2mm). Two contact-point shapes coexist: legacy (angle/width/radius/thickness) and arc-segment (arcStart/arcEnd/rInner/rOuter). `resolveCpBounds()` normalises both.

### Combat

Special moves run a 5-phase state machine (idle → windup → executing → bleed → cooldown). Invulnerability is applied in the executing phase. Opponents can cancel a special during executing via QTE. `controlLockedUntilMs` blocks movement for the special's duration. **The new `SpecialMoveConfig` (steps[]) schema is defined in `shared/types/specialMove.ts` but rooms may still load the incompatible hardcoded `SpecialMoveDef` from `server/constants/specialMoves.ts` — this must be verified and resolved.**

Combos: `detectCombo()` uses a 3-key sliding window with per-combo cooldowns, power threshold checks, attached-combo check, and type restrictions. Six trigger-type combos run `detectTriggerCombos()` each tick. **Critical: `ComboDoc` in Firestore has no `effectId` field, so combos cannot reference their `ComboEffectDef` — all combos are effectively trigger-only stubs.**

### Arena

`ArenaFeatureProcessor.processArenaFeatures()` handles 14 feature types per tick. All of: loops, obstacles, pits, water, portals, turrets, bumps, floor hazards, switches, self-rotation — are fully wired. Gravity wells and spin zones use `executeBehavior()` which **only handles `movement.orbit`**. All other BehaviorRef behaviorIds (factor.*, transform.*, spawn.*, movement.circle/dash/retreat, arena.*) produce a console warning and no-op. This is the single largest runtime gap.

### AI

Three difficulty tiers (medium/hard/hell). Hell uses 10-tick prediction, ring-out awareness, and periodic combo emission. Legacy "easy" collapses to medium. All tiers are `computeInput()` pure functions.

### Multiplayer

Four room types. Series format BO1/3/5 via `SeriesManager`. Spectator support across all rooms. Tournament system with 30s scheduler poll, 3-min room cap, both-ready early-start, quit walkovers, and `tournamentPoints` leaderboard scoring.

## What is Broken or Missing

### CRITICAL (blocks gameplay correctness)

1. **BehaviorRef dispatch gap** — `ArenaFeatureProcessor.executeBehavior()` only handles `movement.orbit`. All other compiled BehaviorRef types are silently skipped. Every `ComboEffectDef` task that compiles to anything other than orbit (multiplier boosts, transformations, spawning, circle movement, arena effects) has zero effect at runtime. Fix: add dispatch cases for all `factor.*`, `transform.*`, `spawn.*`, `movement.*`, `arena.*` behaviorIds.

2. **`effectId` absent from `ComboDoc`** — The `combos` Firestore collection documents do not have an `effectId` field. `detectCombo()` returns a `ComboResult` but cannot look up what `ComboEffectDef` to execute. Fix: add `effectId?: string` to the combo document schema and the admin combo editor.

3. **Special move schema incompatibility** — `server/constants/specialMoves.ts` defines `SpecialMoveDef` (simple `effects{}` object). The new pipeline expects `SpecialMoveConfig` (steps[], windupTicks, bleedTicks, cancelableByQTE). These are not compatible. Room onCreate must be verified to load from Firestore `special_moves` collection using the new schema, not the hardcoded constant.

### HIGH (blocks authored content)

4. **No step editor for Special Moves** — The admin special moves page must be rebuilt with a `SpecialMoveStep[]` editor: each step picks a `comboEffectId`, sets timing (windupTicks, bleedTicks), and can toggle `cancelableByQTE`. The `cameraConfig` field per step also needs an authoring surface.

5. **No `ComboTask` editor for Combo Effects** — The admin combo effects page must be rebuilt with a task list editor supporting all 5 ComboTask action types (multiplier, transformation, spawning, movement, arena_effect) and all 29 StatDeltaKey values. `ComboTrigger[]` and `ComboTiming` must also be authorable.

6. **Missing COLLECTIONS entries** — `mechanic_defs`, `gimmick_defs`, `camera_profiles`, `audio_profiles` are not in the `COLLECTIONS` constant in `client/src/lib/firebase.ts`. Any code referencing these will use raw string literals inconsistently.

### MEDIUM (limits features)

7. **Trigger zone BehaviorRef** — Arena trigger zones (`triggerZones[]`) dispatch BehaviorRef through the same `executeBehavior()` gap. All trigger-zone effects beyond `movement.orbit` are inoperative.

8. **`roundModifier_defs` collection status** — `MODIFIER_MAP` is a hardcoded constant. It is unknown whether `round_modifiers` Firestore collection is read at runtime or ignored. If hardcoded, new modifier types cannot be authored without code changes.

9. **Arena links / BeyLinks partial** — `ArenaLink` and `BeyLink` types are defined and imported in BattleRoom, but physics implementation is partial. Corridor traversal and multi-bey linking strain mechanics are incomplete.

### LOW

10. **Gamepad input** — Bitmask bits 0–9 are defined but no gamepad event reader is wired in `useGameInput.ts`.
11. **Admin pages for gimmicks, mechanics, camera profiles, audio profiles** — Not built. These are P1/P2 priorities in the rebuild.

## Stat System

360-point distribution across attack / defense / stamina (max 150 each).

| Stat | Formula | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `attack` | `damageMultiplier = 1.0 + attack × 0.007` | 1.0×–2.05× |
| `defense` | `damageReduction = 1 − defense × 0.003` | 0–55% reduction |
| `stamina` | `spinDecayRate = 8 × (1 − stamina × 0.001)` | 8–6.8/tick |
| `stamina` | `maxSpin = ceil(2000 × (1 + stamina × 0.0008))` | 2000–2240 |
| `stamina` | `spinStealFactor = 0.1 × (1 + stamina × 0.02667)` | 0.1–0.5 |

StatDelta supports 29 numeric keys for in-match stat modification (combo effects, special moves, round modifiers).

## Physics Coordinate System

| Unit | Value |
|------|-------|
| 1 cm | 24 px |
| 1 em | 16 px |
| Arena radius | `min(w, h) × 0.45` px |
| Beyblade radius | `stats.radius × 24` px |
| Standard arena | 1080×1080 px stored |

## Priority Fix Order for Implementation Stages

1. Add `effectId` to `combos` schema + admin combo editor (Stage 4)
2. Wire `SpecialMoveConfig` pipeline end-to-end, remove/alias hardcoded `SpecialMoveDef` (Stage 2)
3. Implement full `executeBehavior()` dispatch for all BehaviorRef types (Stage 6 / mechanic dispatch)
4. Add `mechanic_defs`, `gimmick_defs`, `camera_profiles`, `audio_profiles` to COLLECTIONS (Stage 11)
5. Build `SpecialMoveStep[]` admin editor (Stage 2 admin UI)
6. Build `ComboTask[]` admin editor (Stage 4 admin UI)
7. Verify and complete `round_modifiers` Firestore loading path (Stage 14)
8. Complete arena link / BeyLink physics (Stage 10)
